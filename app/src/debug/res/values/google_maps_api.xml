    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=F3:87:5C:6E:F4:5B:B4:3A:E9:C1:2E:53:09:1B:D6:9E:09:05:75:BF%3Bcom.amohnacs.faircarrental

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    F3:87:5C:6E:F4:5B:B4:3A:E9:C1:2E:53:09:1B:D6:9E:09:05:75:BF

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    F3:87:5C:6E:F4:5B:B4:3A:E9:C1:2E:53:09:1B:D6:9E:09:05:75:BF

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

    <!-- The google maps API would usually be hidden in the private gradle.properties folder.  We are making it accessible here for ease of testing by the devs at Fair -->
